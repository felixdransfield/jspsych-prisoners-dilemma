If creating your experiment is not possible with the current set of jsPsych plugins, consider [writing a new plugin](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki/Create-a-Plugin). The core jsPsych library provides a framework for constructing experiments by managing the presentation of trials and recording data. It may be faster to develop a jsPsych compatible plugin than writing an experiment from scratch. You will also be able to take advantage of all of the other jsPsych plugins for basic tasks like displaying instructions.
